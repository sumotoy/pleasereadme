# what is going on sumotoy and his libraries?
I'm not disappeared...<br>
Last year, around August I got disease, in the same year, around november a loved member of my family was in Hospital and in less than a month left us, this caused a coincidence of problems over problems so my spare time dissolved.<br>
That's life, there's things over your control and nothing I can do, I accepted but have to stop some activities.<br>
I will go back here? Sure, I already started, but slowly... I got disease as well so I cannot spend too much time.<br>
I've enjoy a lot helping community to build something amazing, I got several projects videos and pictures from people that used my libraries and I'm always happy to see those things but in the same time got lot of bad letters from people that pretend this and that, fix this... 
Everyone need a break during life, last year was my turn and I'm happy to still be here to say this...
Please understand.<br>
