# please read me
I'm not disappeared...
Last year, around August I got disease, in the same year, around november a loved member of my family was in Hospital and in less than a month left us, this caused a coincidence of problems over problems so my spare time dissolved.
That's life, there's things over your control and nothing I can do, I accepted but have to stop some activities.
I will go back here? Sure, I already started, but slowly... I got disease as well so I cannot spend too much time.
Please understand.
